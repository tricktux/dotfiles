# FAQ:					
# - See `:Man muttrc` for help
# - /var/spool/mail/<USER> does not exist/is not a mailbox
# - You skipped putting gnupg password. Close terminal and start again
# - Selecting multiple messages
# You can also use t to tag or untag the highlighted message, to fine-tune the selection.
# Then you can run tag-prefix (;) followed by save-message (s), and it will prompt you for a mailbox name
# Fri Jun 30 2017 14:47: Super awesome discovery:
# - F toogles the message important flag
# - With Gmail this flagged is linked to the Starred Documents

# Mounting or Unmounting devices via the terminal
# This script requires that you have sudo installed and that you have sudo rights.
# Create an executable file /usr/local/bin/usbstick.sh:

# Set the number of USB port available
usbCount=4
# ^ You have to create as many directories as USB port available
#   ( e.g. run the commands 'sudo mkdir /mnt/usbstick1'
#   to 'sudo mkdir /mnt/usbstick4' prior to running this script )

# Search for new devices starting by /dev/sdX with X the value of
deviceStart="c" #/dev/sdb
# ^ To list only new devices, you have to jump over the ones
#   already set. If you have 1 main drive (/dev/sda), start with
#   "b" (/dev/sdb) as value for this variable

# Search for new device(s)
lsblk -no NAME,UUID,FSTYPE,LABEL,MOUNTPOINT | grep -e "sd[$deviceStart-z][0-9]" > /tmp/usbstick
deviceCount=$(cat /tmp/usbstick | wc -l)

	echo "No new device detected"
	exit 0
